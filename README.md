# Backend Learning Project

This repository contains my journey learning the fundamentals of modern backend development using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Prisma**, and **Docker**.

## Overview

A collection of projects progressing from basic concepts to a fully containerized application with database integration and authentication.

## Technologies Learned

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript, ES6 modules, scalable applications
- **Express.js**: RESTful APIs, middleware, routing, static file serving
- **Prisma**: ORM, schema migrations, PostgreSQL integration
- **Docker**: Containerization, Dockerfile, Docker Compose

## Key Features

RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, database integration, CRUD operations, password hashing, Docker containerization

## Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with RESTful API development, database design, authentication patterns, containerization, environment configuration, and modern JavaScript.
